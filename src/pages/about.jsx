        <strong>Greenify</strong> is a community-powered tree planting and growth tracking platform. Our mission is to inspire people to take environmental action by planting trees and nurturing them with care. By using technology like GPS mapping, photo galleries, and real-time growth updates, weâ€™re making tree planting fun, transparent, and impactful.
